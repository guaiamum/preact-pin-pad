#  How to's:

## I wanna see it working!
First install all dependencies locally by running:

`yarn`

Then, to run a local dev server, run:

`yarn start`

OR, if you'd like to see it built and compressed:

`yarn build`

## Wanna contribute:

After making your changes and **creating new tests** (..., right?) run the following to guarantee you haven't broken the world :D

`yarn test`
